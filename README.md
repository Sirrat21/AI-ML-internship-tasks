## Task 1: Iris Dataset Analysis

### **Objective**
Analyze the Iris dataset to understand the relationship between flower features and species types.

###  **Dataset**
- **Iris Dataset** (150 samples with sepal and petal measurements)

###  **Models Applied**
- No predictive model applied; focused on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**

###  **Key Findings**
- **Petal size** clearly separates the species.
- **Setosa** is the easiest species to identify.
- **Histograms** showed feature distributions.
- **Box plots** helped detect a few outliers.
- The dataset is **clean and ready** for machine learning tasks.

##  Task 2: Stock Price Prediction

### **Objective**
Predict the next dayâ€™s closing price using historical stock data.

###  **Dataset**
- Historical **stock price data**

### **Models Applied**
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

### **Key Findings**
- **Random Forest** outperformed Linear Regression.
- Predictions were **close to actual prices**, capturing **short-term trends** effectively.

##  Task 6: House Price Prediction

###  **Objective**
Predict housing prices based on property features like area, bedrooms, and location.

###  **Dataset**
- **Housing Price Dataset** (from Kaggle)

###  **Models Applied**
- **Linear Regression**

###  **Key Findings**
- The model provided **reasonably accurate predictions**.
- Shows good capability in capturing **pricing trends**.
- Further improvement possible using advanced models like **Gradient Boosting**.
